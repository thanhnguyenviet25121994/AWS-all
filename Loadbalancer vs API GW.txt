1. There are 2 types of load balancers: Network and App.
- They are pretty much the same in configurations and everything, but Network loadbalncer has listener on TCP/UDP/TLS (L4) while app load has listener on http/https. 
- Network load balancer can handler much more traffic while application loadbalancer handle only http/https - which is usually for web apps. 
- Network lb can be assigned with an static public IP while the other cannot.
- Network lb can route traffic to app lb, but not vice verse. 
- The biggest difference is about use case. Network lb is for large enterprises while app lb for medium to small enterprise, who only runs web apps on aws. 
- Cost: NLB is the fastest and for large businesses so it is the most expensive


*** Note: 
- NLB handle all traffic (both TCP and UDP) so is is much more stronger than alb. As a result, it is more expensive and for large enterprise
- TLS listener is used for TLS offloading (it still uses TCP). Backend does not need to encrypt data. NLB does it. Add a cert to NLB. When client send request, NLB decrypt it and send it back to backend in http. 

2. API gw vs loadbalancer:
- API gw can forward traffic to different targets based on requested url, while loadbalancer cannot. However, API gw can loadbalance as well. So API gw is an improved version of load balancer. 
- API gw can also authenticate request.
